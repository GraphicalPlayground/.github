# Graphical Playground (GP)
### Learning Graphics Engineering. Not Using Engines.

Graphical Playground is a hybrid ecosystem designed to democratize **Graphics Engineering**. We bridge the gap between high-level creative tools and low-level hardware programming by providing a frictionless, cloud-native environment for building modern rendering systems.

## The Vision
Graphics engineering is often perceived as an opaque and elitist field. Most existing paths teach you how to *use* a tool (Unreal/Unity), but few teach you how to *build* one. 

GP is built on a **"Deconstructionist" pedagogy**:
1. **Abstract:** Start with high-level API abstractions to visualize results immediately.
2. **Understand:** Dive into the math, memory layouts, and hardware constraints.
3. **Reimplement:** Strip away the abstraction and rewrite the systems yourself—from RHI to Raytracing.

## The Ecosystem
The GP project is distributed across specialized repositories to ensure a production-grade modular architecture:

### The Core Engine
* [**gp-engine**](https://github.com/GraphicalPlayground/gp-engine): A high-performance C++ multi-platform library. The primary medium for learning architecture, RHI, and modern GPU pipelines.

### The Platform
* [**gp-platform**](https://github.com/GraphicalPlayground/gp-platform): Our cloud-native learning environment. Code in the browser, render on real remote GPUs.
* [**gp-infrastructure**](https://github.com/GraphicalPlayground/gp-infrastructure): Orchestration for remote GPU execution and scalable VM rendering services.

### Education & Certification
* [**gp-curriculum**](https://github.com/GraphicalPlayground/gp-curriculum): The structured syllabus from basic algorithms to advanced engine design.
* [**gp-handbook**](https://github.com/GraphicalPlayground/gp-handbook): The theory-to-implementation reference guide.
* [**gp-certifications**](https://github.com/GraphicalPlayground/gp-certifications): Project-based validation of engineering skills.

### Community & Open Source
* [**gp-docs**](https://github.com/GraphicalPlayground/gp-docs): Comprehensive documentation, API references, and contribution guidelines.
* [**gp-experiments**](https://github.com/GraphicalPlayground/gp-experiments): A sandbox for community-driven projects, demos, and research.
* [**gp-sample-projects**](https://github.com/GraphicalPlayground/gp-sample-projects): A collection of open-source projects built on top of the GP engine, showcasing various techniques and applications.
